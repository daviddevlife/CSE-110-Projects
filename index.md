# **David Chang**

##### About Me #####
Hi there! My name is David Chang. I like to listen to music in my spare time. 
###### Dancing Queen ######
The lyrics of ABBA - Dancing Queen:

> You are the dancing queen | Young and sweet | Only seventeen
#### Programming ####
I have knowledge in C/C++, which you can use `new` to create an object/array as dynamic memory. For instance: 
```
int * arr;
arr = new int[9];
```

Other things I like to do is watching [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) and browsing [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/en/). [View the Dancing Queen section for the song I like](#dancing-queen).

### *Anime* ###

One of my favorite animes is Hunter x Hunter

I also have a dog named [Luna](/IMG_3552.JPG). She's an amazing friend to be with. She's also hyper and is always looking forward to playing fetch.

Adding on to the music section [here](#dancing-queen), my favorite songs currently are 
- **24+25 by Ariana Grande**
- **Kiss Me More by Doja Cat**
- **Deja Vu by Olivia Rodrigo**

I love to eat as well. My favorite cuisines are 
1. Spicy Eggplant
2. Banh Xeo (Vietnamese pancake)
3. Eggrolls
4. Chicken Tikka Masala

For the things I will need to do in the meantime this quarter are the following:
- [x] Buy an iClicker
- [ ] Purchase textbooks for other CSE classes
